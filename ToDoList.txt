1)
open either type of file (blank file and .csv)
read the contents line by line to print <-- testing
split the contents by both '  ' and ,
add the contents to the database

2)
add items to the screen for each line in the database
Populate those items with channel + other options

3)
buttons to choose what to add to the items
repopulate the items based on those choices

4)
logic to find errors i.e. address out of range, address overlapping
highlight items with an error to make them obvious
text appears when hovering over highlighted items to show the error
